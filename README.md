Dear Reader,

Welcome to my "Final Project - Feature" For CAGD320 Coding class 

My final is making or replicating as close as possible a Feature from a Video Game, I chosen TitanFall 2 (Wall Running).

So When Downloading My Game 
Here are the Instructions for playing my game
WASD keys on your keyboard = Movement,
SPACEBAR Key on your keyboard = Jumping,
Mouse = Is to look around in full First Person View

So In game there are Walls and platforms for you to " Test My Feature"
1) Move the player to get used to the movement and looking and jumping
2) Move your character by walking and then jumping onto to the Horiztonal Wall
3) When doing step 2 continue to move across the wall until you meet the other platform
4) And if you fall just re-Launch the game
Please Enjoy and have fun
